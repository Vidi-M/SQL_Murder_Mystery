## Starting Information
A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the crime was a **â€‹murderâ€‹** that occurred sometime on **â€‹Jan.15, 2018**â€‹ and that it took place in **â€‹SQL Cityâ€‹**. Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police departmentâ€™s database.

Using a subquery ensures that the query dynamically retrieves the correct ID, keeping the database operations accurate and up-to-date without manual intervention. It is a good practice despite this datebase not being regularly updated.

### First Witness Interview
```
SELECT * 
	FROM interview 
		WHERE person_id IN 
			(SELECT id 
			 FROM person 
			 WHERE address_street_name = 'Northwestern Dr' 
			 ORDER BY address_number DESC LIMIT 1)
```
| person_id | transcript                                                                                                                               |

| 14887     | I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out. He had a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag. The membership number on the bag started with "48Z". Only gold members have those bags. The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W". |
